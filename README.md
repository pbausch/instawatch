==========

A quick way to view instagram feeds on a web page with PHP and MySQL.

This uses [PHP Instagram API](https://github.com/galen/PHP-Instagram-API). Follow the instructions there and then create *instagram.php* in the *credentials* directory. Storing the Instagram token in a database is probably overkill, but I plan to do more with that down the road.
